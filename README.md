## **PROJECT SUMMARY**

### **DESCRIPTION**

We have designed an interactive web visualization project that showcases aspects of Commercial Real Estate in Canada. Our primary target audience is real estate investors familiar with the nuanced variables and concepts presented in this project. 

### VISUALIZATIONS

   - Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
   - Consumer Spending
   - Mortgage Rate
   - Unemployment Rates

2. **SECTOR & MARKET INFO (Elizabeth Koch):**
   - Market & Sector Infographic
   - Canadian Population Growth

3. **INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE (Naina Garg):**
   - Capital Value for Sectors and Markets
   - Income return, Capital growth, and Total return for Sectors and Markets
   
4. **INDUSTRIAL SECTOR (Elizabeth Koch):**
   - Vacancy & Rent Growth Rates in 6 Markets
   - National Absorption, New Supply, and Availability Rate 

### **RECOMMENDATION**

We recommend investing in Canada's industrial real estate sector. Through a set of innovative and intuitive web visualizations, we highlight significant macroeconomic movements in Canada, the performance of commercial real estate across four sectors and six markets during economic fluctuations, and how the industrial sector has consistently produced high returns and net growth for investors.
